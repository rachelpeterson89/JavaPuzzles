# JavaPuzzles
Coding Dojo Java Assignment

Puzzling
After you passed the first challenge, the company decided they wanted to give you a few puzzles to solve. As they put it: "The first challenge was just to check your familiarity with the language, now we want to see your problem-solving skills."

For this assignment, we are going to introduce two new classes: Collections and Random. We are going to use the former to shuffle and sort a collection, and the latter to get a random output. For example:

CodeExample.java
import java.util.ArrayList;
import java.util.Collections;
import java.util.Random;
public class CodeExample {
    public static void main() {
        ArrayList<Integer> numbers = new ArrayList<Integer>();
        numbers.add(5);
        numbers.add(4);
        numbers.add(3);
        numbers.add(2);
        numbers.add(1);
        
        Collections.shuffle(numbers);
        System.out.println(numbers); // [1, 5, 2, 4, 3]
        Collections.sort(numbers);
        System.out.println(numbers); // [1, 2, 3, 4, 5]
                
        Random r = new Random();
        System.out.println(r.nextInt()); // without bounds
        System.out.println(r.nextInt(5)); // with bounds 0 to 5
    }
}
Objectives:
● Implement different algorithms in java.

● Practice Array and ArrayList.

● Practice loops.

● Learn and use the Collections and Random classes.

Tasks:
Work on the puzzles below. Make your code as clean as possible. The class name should be PuzzleJava; you will need to create methods for each of the tasks below and test them in the main method.

● Create an array with the following values: 3,5,1,2,7,9,8,13,25,32. Print the sum of all numbers in the array. Also have the function return an array that only includes numbers that are greater than 10 (e.g. when you pass the array above, it should return an array with the values of 13,25,32)

● Create an array with the following values: Nancy, Jinichi, Fujibayashi, Momochi, Ishikawa. Shuffle the array and print the name of each person. Have the method also return an array with names that are longer than 5 characters.

● Create an array that contains all 26 letters of the alphabet (this array must have 26 values). Shuffle the array and, after shuffling, display the last letter from the array. Have it also display the first letter of the array. If the first letter in the array is a vowel, have it display a message.

To shuffle a collection, you can use the shuffle method of the Collections class. Collections Class documentation
● Generate and return an array with 10 random numbers between 55-100.

To get a random integer, you can use the nextInt method of the Random class. Random Class documentation
● Generate and return an array with 10 random numbers between 55-100 and have it be sorted (showing the smallest number in the beginning). Display all the numbers in the array. Next, display the minimum value in the array as well as the maximum value.

To sort a collection, you can use the sort method of the Collections class.
● Create a random string that is 5 characters long.

● Generate an array with 10 random strings that are each 5 characters long
